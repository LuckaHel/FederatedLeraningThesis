# Federated Learning MBTI Classifier (Demo App)

This repository includes a small demonstration app from my Master's thesis.  
It showcases a **DistilBERT-based** MBTI personality classifier trained using **Federated Learning**.

ðŸ§ª **Model Details**:
- Trained on a **balanced dataset**
- Simulated over **16 clients**
- Uses the **DistilBERT** model architecture
- Evaluates personality prediction using textual input

ðŸš€ **Live Demo**:

This app demonstrates a basic inference endpoint and is part of the larger study comparing centralized and federated learning methods for NLP tasks.
