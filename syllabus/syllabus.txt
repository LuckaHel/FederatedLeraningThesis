        Client Simulations:
            Division by personality traits (e.g., introverts vs. extroverts).
            Randomized and stratified sampling for client data.
    Experiment Design:
        Impact of Client Numbers:
            Evaluate model performance with varying numbers of clients.
        Personality-Specific Training:
            Train models with data from introverts, extroverts, and mixed groups.
        Feature-Based Experiments:
            Assess the contribution of linguistic features (e.g., LIWC, n-grams) to predictions.
    Evaluation Metrics:
        Accuracy, precision/recall, F1-score.

7. Discussion

    Findings:
        Implications for federated learning with personality traits.
        How introvert/extrovert-specific training impacts performance.
    Limitations:
        Constraints of using MBTI data alone.
        Platform-specific and demographic biases.
    Future Work:
        Suggest expanding the dataset scope to include more diverse data sources.
        Propose integrating Big Five personality traits for broader applicability.

8. Conclusion

    Recap of the research objectives and findings.
    Contributions to the fields of federated learning and personality-based NLP.
    Closing thoughts on the potential of personality analysis in social robotics.

Adjustments Without PANDORA

    The focus shifts entirely to leveraging the MBTI9k dataset, which remains a robust dataset for personality-focused analysis.
    Highlight the dataset's text-rich content as a unique advantage, compensating for the lack of Big Five data.
    Strengthen the argument by emphasizing the scalability of experiments and the potential insights derived from introvert/extrovert analyses.
